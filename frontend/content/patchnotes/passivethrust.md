Hello again! It's time for an UPDATE!!!

## ‚ú® Crew cosmetics

You can now use your squidcoin at certain planets to buy backgrounds and taglines for your player character!
These are visible in the crew overview pane, the ship schematic, and anywhere else your icon shows up.
Style on 'em.

(This also means, yes, I reset the planet levels again to give some planets crew cosmetics)

## ü™ê Visible panet prices

Members of the traders' guild and owners of certain scanners can see vendor cargo prices when they are within broadcast range.

## üë©‚Äç‚úàÔ∏è Big time piloting changes!

Gone! are the days of thrusting wildly and discovering hours later that gravity yanked you off course.
Gone! are the days of having entirely different paradigms for piloting and munitions.

Now!
Being in the cockpit applies passive thrust. You will gradually add thrust toward your targeted location.
On that note, target locations can now track moving targets ‚Äî i.e. comets, ships, etc. Your fellow crew members' target locations are also visible on the map.

Braking bonuses still work ‚Äî you'll gain appropriate bonuses for applying thrust against the ship's current trajectory.

Discord commands around movement have also been updated, and should be generally more useful now (added direction and distance to targets), as well.

If you find that you have been kicked off of a comet, etc because of the movement changes, let me know and I'll personally place you back.

As always, these are tentative changes, but I think it's an interesting new way to move around, and I hope you have some fun with it.

### Other minor changes
- tutorial updated to use new motion system
- log entries now can have positive looking colors
- buyable stamina expansion crew passive
- captain orders to follow contracts
- discord bot doesn't respond to multiple prefixes ("...")
- and many more!

### Coming soon
- AI upgrades to use the same motion system
- Movement tweaks and upgrades (the ability to actually stop entirely lol)
