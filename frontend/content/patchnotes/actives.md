Hello again! Happy new year to every fish in the sea, and those in space too.
It's been a little quiet around these parts, what with teavel and family and whatnot, but that doesn't mean nothing is in the works!

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Active Abilities

This one's been a long time coming.

All characters now gain active abilities based on their species and overall character level!

Gain character levels to unlock new abilities and improve the effectiveness of your existing abilities. Ability unlock trees have some overlap, but are generally unique to each species onboard.

I'll be adding more actives in the future, but this should get us started :)

## üí™ Endurance Stat

There is a new stat on the block, endurance!

Endurance is gained by being awake and active on the ship, regardless of what you're doing. Earning levels in endurance will increase your maximum stamina. This means that everyone starting from level 1 endurance will have lower stamina than you're used to, but it will scale up over time to be higher than you had before!

(Thanks to @Trebecca on the support server for the idea!)

## üé≠ Morale

This has been live for a bit, but I haven't posted about it, so here goes!

Morale is an individual metric that is gained and lost through various positive and negative events on the ship, such as gaining cargo, landing on a planet, or taking damage. High morale will come with a productivity boost, but sink low enough and you might find yourself face to face with space madness.

Morale passively falls when offworld, and passively rises when planetside. Morale falls slower while sleeping.

### Other minor changes

- Added a frontend setting to disable animations for slower computers
- Rebalanced armor to be slightly more effective for the weight cost
- Skills required for Repairs and Weapons have been swapped
- The starfish.cool website has been generally upgraded to look more like the game, go check it out!
