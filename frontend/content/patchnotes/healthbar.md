## ðŸ›  Passive thrust changes

You asked, I heard. Passive thrust is really tough to handle without manual engines backing it up, so we've now added manual thrust back to all low-level engines, with passive thrust being much more of a rarity.
Passive thrust will now be roughly 1000% more aggressive on matching the ship's trajectory to the targeted angle.
Also, passive thrust is now called "auto-nav" because it sounds cooler.

## ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­ New health bars

Health bars have been revamped to hopefully be more useful and look more like health bars.

## ðŸ’¸ Price tooltips

You can now hover over the price of cargo, items, passives, etc to see **exactly** why a price is set the way it is! You can see planet-level features, charisma bonuses, individual cargo price modifiers, all that good min-max-y stuff.

## Minor changes

- Charisma now impacts buy & sell prices!
- Buying and selling now grants Charisma experience!

- And more!
