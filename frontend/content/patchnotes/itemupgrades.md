New features, who dis?

## ðŸ›  Item upgrades

What's that? A new room on the ship? That's right, it's the LAB! In the Lab, you can research all sorts of things. Okay, just one type of thing for now.

Items can now be upgraded! Upgrades will require time and materials, and convey passive upgrades to certain properties of your equipment. Different equipment can be upgraded in different ways â€” check it out!

## ðŸ’ª Stats renamed

Your character stats are now broken down into classic RPG stats: Strength, Dexterity, Charisma, Intellect (okay, yes, I changed Intelligence to Intellect. sue me)
This is mostly a cosmetic change, but I hope to have some more uses for these in the future ðŸ˜‰

### Other minor changes:

- "Crew average target" should properly reflect "stop" if it is the only crew target
- masonry pane reflow fixes
- should be impossible to end up in a state of permanently spinning around instead of stopping at your target
- and many more!
