Making some changes to mining and weapons, two things that have been a bit less fun than intended. Mining should be faster in general, and weapons all charge at the same rate now, regardless of how many you have.

In other news! There's a new crew panel with icons for each member. Expect some new squidcoin buyables to come through soon around that! Use any discord command to have your icon show up on the frontend ðŸ˜‰
(Ignore that the "member since" number started just now, I've only now begun to track that stat ^^)

On top of that, I've added a new notification level that will @mention crew members (for truly critical moments), and I've also implemented a new style for log entries, which should generally be more concise overall.
