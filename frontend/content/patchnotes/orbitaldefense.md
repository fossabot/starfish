Testing out a protected zone at the center of the universe where humans cannot attack one another â€” let me know what you think! (It required me to reset the homeworlds so they would be within the protected zone ðŸ˜› )

Also, some planets now have orbital defense! They'll occasionally attack anything non-allied in range that has attacked/been attacked recently.
