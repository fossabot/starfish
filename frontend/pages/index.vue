          This is an early version of a new kind of game â€”
          one that happens in real-time, spans across the
          web and Discord, and enables teamwork in a whole
          new way.

          To play, you will need:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Admin powers in a
              <a href="https://discord.com/" target="_blank"
                >Discord</a

          around the gameplay, plus
          <nuxt-link to="/feedback/bugreport"

          for any bugs you find, but more than anything
          <nuxt-link to="/feedback/storytime"
            >I want to hear your stories</nuxt-link
          >. What happened in-game that felt memorable or
          epic? What left an impression, or made you feel a
          strong emotion?

          Thank you so much for playing! Feel free to play
          as much or as little as you like, with as many

          you like.
