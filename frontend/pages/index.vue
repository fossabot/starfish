          This is an early version of a new kind of game â€”
          one that happens in real-time, spans across the
          web and Discord, and enables teamwork in a whole
          new way.

          To play, you will need:
          <ul>

              Admin powers in a
              <a href="https://discord.com/" target="_blank"

          During the alpha, I'm looking for
          <nuxt-link to="/feedback">feedback</nuxt-link>
          around the gameplay, plus
          <nuxt-link to="/feedback/bugreport"
            >bug reports</nuxt-link
          >
          for any bugs you find, but more than anything
          <nuxt-link to="/feedback/storytime"
            >I want to hear your stories</nuxt-link
          >. What happened in-game that felt memorable or
          epic? What left an impression, or made you feel a
          strong emotion?

          Thank you so much for playing! Feel free to play
          as much or as little as you like, with as many
          ships as you like, with as many crew members as
          you like.
