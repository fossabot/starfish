          Humans really did a number on that one, huh?<br />
          They did a pretty good job of wiping each other
          out, though.<br />
          Not that we were left with much after they all
          died off...
        </div>
        <div>
          Us fish had to rush to evolve our brains and
          technology to the point where we could escape from
          the dying planet we were left on.
        </div>
        <div>
          Now, <b>starships full of fish</b> roam the skies,
          colonizing the galaxy with aquatic utopias
          wherever we can.
        </div>
        <div>
          But it's not just fish out here in space. If only!
          Some of the craftier species of birds also made it
          off of Earth. They haven't changed at all ‚Äî
          they'll hunt down any fish they get their beady
          little eyes on.
        </div>
        <div>
          Besides the fish and the birds, no one's sure who
          or what else managed to make it off of Earth.

          Back on Earth, you were a big fish in a small
          pond. Now, you find yourself cast into the murky
          depths of the universe. You and your shipmates
          will have to pool your courage to make a splash
          among the stars. Welcome to <b>{{ c.gameName }}</b

          It's a game about exploring the universe in a ship
          crewed by your server's members, going on
          adventures and overcoming challenges.

          {{ c.gameName }} feels somewhat like a board game.
          Your adventure will take place over the course of
          days and weeks. It's a perfect game for servers
          with members all over the world, who might only
          have a few minutes per day to play.
