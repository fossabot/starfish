      <h3>Remember Earth?</h3>
      <div>
        Humans really did a number on that one, huh?<br />
        They did a pretty good job of wiping each other out,
        though.<br />
        Not that we were left with much after they all died
        off...
      </div>
      <div>
        Us fish had to rush to evolve our brains and
        technology to the point where we could escape from
        the dying planet we were left on.
      </div>
      <div>
        Now, <b>starships full of fish</b> roam the skies,
        colonizing the galaxy with aquatic utopias wherever
        we can.
      </div>
      <div>
        But it's not just fish out here in space. If only!
        Some of the craftier species of birds also made it
        off of Earth. They haven't changed at all â€” they'll
        hunt down any fish they get their beady little eyes
        on.
      </div>
      <div>
        Besides the fish and the birds, no one's sure who or
        what else managed to make it off of Earth.
      </div>
      <div>
        Back on Earth, you were a big fish in a small pond.
        Now, you find yourself cast into the murky depths of
        the universe. You and your shipmates will have to
        pool your courage to make a splash among the stars.
        Welcome to <b>{{ c.gameName }}</b
        >!
      </div>

      <h3>What is {{ c.gameName }}?</h3>
      <div class="marbot">
        {{ c.gameName }} is
        <b
          >Discord server vs. Discord server space
          action!</b
        >
        It's a game about exploring the universe in a ship
        crewed by your server's members, going on adventures
        and overcoming challenges.
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Get into huge-scale battles with rival factions of
          real servers on Discord!
        </li>
        <li>
          Communicate (poorly) with ships from all over the
          world!
        </li>
        <li>
          Upgrade your ship, level up your character, and
          trade your way to riches!
        </li>
        <li>And much more!</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="marbot">
        {{ c.gameName }} feels somewhat like a board game.
        Your adventure will take place over the course of
        days and weeks. It's a perfect game for servers with
        members all over the world, who might only have a
        few minutes per day to play.
