Spacecrab to me is about accessibility, it’s about whimsy, it’s got some soul to it

The vibe isn’t High Sci FI Eve Online whatever
It’s crabs :crab: exploring the universe for the first time

Crabs finally got the cognitive leap needed for language and shipbuilding

So player characters are all crabs

This to me is a good weird Stand Apart
About our game
Nobody else is doin this
Sort of a Weird Nintendo universe vibe

I was also picturing like younger players telling their parents about this fun new game
